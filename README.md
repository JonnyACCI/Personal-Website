# My Personal Website
I made this website using HTML CSS JS to show off my experience, projects, and skills.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0fb2b99d-81c1-4a97-abc3-5c789e61bfe3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tubular-sawine-968407/deploys)

### Summary
The website has four distinct sections:
1. **The home page**
2. **My Experience**
3. **My Projects**
4. **My Skills**

More sections will be added as necessary. For instance, when I get more work experience, I can add a section for it.
Once a logo is finalized, it can be added to the site.

### Home Page
