# My Personal Website
I made this website using HTML CSS JS to show off my experience and projects, as well as to provide access to my resume, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

**The website will be made to be compatible on mobile in the near future.**

### Summary
The website has four distinct sections:
1. **The home page**
2. **My Experience**
3. **My Projects**
4. **My Info**

More sections will be added as necessary. For instance, when I get more work experience, I can add a section for it.
Once a logo is finalized, it can be added to the site.

### Home Page
